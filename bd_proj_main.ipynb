GOES satellites provide the kind of continuous monitoring necessary for intensive data analysis. They hover continuously over one position on the surface. The satellites orbit high enough to allow for a full-disc view of the Earth. Because they stay above a fixed spot on the surface, they provide a constant vigil for the atmospheric \"triggers\" for severe weather conditions such as tornadoes, flash floods, hailstorms, and hurricanes. When these conditions develop, the GOES satellites are able to monitor storm development and track their movements.\n","\n","#### Links\n","\n","[GOES-16 with Dask and Fargate](https://nbviewer.org/github/awslabs/amazon-asdi/blob/main/examples/dask/notebooks/goes16_dask.ipynb)\n","[NEXRAD L2 Python](https://nbviewer.org/gist/dopplershift/356f2e14832e9b676207)\n","[GOES2GO](https://github.com/blaylockbk/goes2go)\n","[GOES16_vis](https://github.com/HamedAlemo/visualize-goes16)\n","[Beginner Guide to GOES](https://www.goes-r.gov/downloads/resources/documents/Beginners_Guide_to_GOES-R_Series_Data.pdf)\n","[Mapping GOES true color](https://unidata.github.io/python-gallery/examples/mapping_GOES16_TrueColor.html#sphx-glr-download-examples-mapping-goes16-truecolor-py)\n","[Visualize GOES-16 from AWS](https://github.com/HamedAlemo/visualize-goes16/blob/master/visualize_GOES16_from_AWS.ipynb)\n","[Browse GOES](https://noaa-goes17.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#ABI-L2-AICEF/2021/097/06/)\n","\n","### GHCN-D\n","\n","https://medium.com/google-cloud/explore-visualize-200-years-of-global-temperature-using-apache-spark-bigquery-and-google-data-699ed8b3c67\n","\n","### CDR\n","\n","https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-cdr-fundamental/\n","\n","### NASA\n","\n","https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/toolkits/wildfires\n","\n","https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd64a1v061/#tools\n","\n","### Wifire\n","\n","https://firemap.sdsc.edu/"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RL5tbU8ZLbwz"},"source":["### Task Ideas"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1yyrLG5gLekI"},"source":["* Experiment with classification accuracy over time frames and shot scales.
